# Farazy Wallet Frontend

This project is currently under development.
The main purpose for this project is to advance my personal software engineering skills. 

Welcome to the Farazy Wallet Frontend repository! This repository contains the frontend code for the Farazy Wallet app, which allows users to simulate how their cryptocurrency portfolio would have performed if they had invested in different cryptocurrencies at a particular time. With Farazy Wallet, users can create a fake crypto wallet and add any amount of their desired cryptocurrencies to the wallet. They can then view their wallet at any time by saving the URL. The app is anonymous and straightforward, and users don't need to log in to access their wallet.

This repository contains the code for the frontend portion of the app. If you're looking for the backend code, you can find it in the [Farazy Wallet Backend repository](https://github.com/BoraSoylu/fw-backend).

## Hosting with Vercel

Eventually, this project will be hosted with Vercel. Vercel is a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions that offers fast and scalable hosting. Once the project is ready for deployment, I will connect the Farazy Wallet repository to Vercel and deploy it using their platform.

In addition, the domain name farazywallet.com has already been acquired for this project. Once the app is deployed on Vercel, I will configure the DNS settings to point to the Vercel deployment, so that users can access the app at [farazywallet.com](https://farazywallet.com).

## Coingecko API

To retrieve cryptocurrency data, Farazy Wallet uses the Coingecko API. Coingecko is a popular cryptocurrency data provider that offers a comprehensive set of APIs for retrieving real-time and historical cryptocurrency data. With the Coingecko API, Farazy Wallet can retrieve the latest prices, market caps, and other cryptocurrency data that is needed to simulate a cryptocurrency portfolio.

For more information on the Coingecko API, please refer to the [official documentation](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation).


## Technologies Used

Farazy Wallet is built using the following technologies:

- **React.js**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React.js makes it easy to create reusable components that can be used across an application.

- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that provides better type checking and developer experience. With TypeScript, developers can catch errors before runtime, which makes the development process more efficient.

- **Next.js**: A popular React framework for building server-side rendered web applications. Next.js provides several benefits, including built-in routing, automatic code splitting, and server-side rendering.

- **ESLint**: A JavaScript linting tool that helps find and fix common coding issues. ESLint ensures that the code adheres to a consistent style and best practices, which makes the code more maintainable.

- **Zod**: A TypeScript-first schema validation library that provides a great developer experience and great performance. With Zod, developers can ensure that data is correctly formatted and validated before being used.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to create responsive and customizable UI components. Tailwind CSS provides several pre-built styles, making it easy to build a consistent and professional-looking user interface.

- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent code style. Prettier automatically formats the code, which saves developers time and ensures that the code adheres to the team's coding standards.

## Learning Topics

Through working on this project, I am learning the following topics:

### Server-side Rendering

Server-side rendering (SSR) is the process of rendering web pages on the server, rather than in the client's web browser. SSR can improve page load times and search engine optimization.

### Client-side Rendering

Client-side rendering (CSR) is the process of rendering web pages in the client's web browser, using JavaScript. CSR can provide a more interactive and dynamic user experience.

### Static HTML Generation

Static HTML generation involves generating HTML files at build time, rather than at runtime. This can improve page load times and reduce server load.

### Debouncing

Debouncing is a technique used to limit the rate at which a function is called. This can prevent performance issues and improve user experience.

### API Usage

API usage involves making HTTP requests to remote servers to retrieve data. This can be used to populate user interfaces with dynamic data.

### Optimizing API Requests

Optimizing API requests involves minimizing the number of HTTP requests made to remote servers, and optimizing the size of those requests. This can improve page load times and reduce server load.

### Cookies

Cookies are small text files that are stored on the user's computer by websites. They can be used to store user preferences and login information.

### Responsive Design

Responsive design is the practice of designing web pages that adjust to different screen sizes and device types, providing a consistent user experience across all devices.

### Dark Mode

Dark mode is a color scheme that uses dark background colors

### Internationalized Routing

Support for multiple languages
